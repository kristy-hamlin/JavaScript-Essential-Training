This repository showcases my progress in the completion of the JavaScript Essential Training course on LinkedIn Learning by Morten Rand-Hendriksen.

By sharing this repository, I aim to demonstrate my commitment to self learning and consistent improvement in programming.

The files in this repository are organized as per the course structure, with some additional folders I have added for notes and practice.

For more details about the course content, see the README file located at ./files/README.md

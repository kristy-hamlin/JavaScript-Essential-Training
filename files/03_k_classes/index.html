    <title>JS Classes: Kristy Notes</title>

    <!--
    When using multiple JS files, they each need to be imported into the
    HMTL file and set as type="module".

    However, recall when you do this you need to understand a few differences
    that apply to JS files loaded as "modules."

    JS modules are automatically "deferred", so you don't need to add that property.
    They are loaded an executed in the order they appear on the page. 

    Also, module-scoped variables don't attach to the window, so you cannot access
    module variables or functions directly fromteh console. 
    
    Hopefully he will talk more about this bc I am a lil confused.

    <p>Keep your JS classes in a separate JS file from your main script.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the HTML file, both scripts must be imported as "modules."</li>
      <li>
        In your class JS file, include your class's code. Export it at the
        bottom of the file.
      </li>
      <li>
        In your main JS file, import the class, and use it as if it was located
        inside that file.
      </li>
    </ul>

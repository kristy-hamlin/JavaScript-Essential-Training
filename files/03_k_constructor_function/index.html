    <title>JS Constructor Functions: Kristy Notes</title>

    <!--
    In this folder we cover an old syntax for creating classes
    using contsructor functions. 
    -->

  <body>
    <h1>JS Constructor Function</h1>
    <p>
      This is an alternate sytnax for creating classes, which uses "Constructor
      Functions". It is less convenient than the method we have alreay covered.
      However, because classes are new to JS, you will see the Constructor
      Function method in old code bases.
